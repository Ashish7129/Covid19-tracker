            <b> Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) </b> is an infectious disease
            caused by a newly discovered coronavirus. Most people who fall sick
            with COVID-19 will experience mild to moderate symptoms and recover
            without special treatment.

            <b>HOW IT SPREADS</b> The virus that causes COVID-19 is mainly
            transmitted through droplets generated when an infected person
            coughs, sneezes, or exhales. These droplets are too heavy to hang in
            the air, and quickly fall on floors or surfaces. You can be infected
            by breathing in the virus if you are within close proximity of
            someone who has COVID-19, or by touching a contaminated surface and
            then your eyes, nose or mouth.
